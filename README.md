# Overview of Numpy Random Package


***


This repository contains an overview of the numpy.random pacakage in a Jupyter notebook.

Create a Jupyter notebook explaining the use of the NumPy random package, including detailed explanations of five of the distributions provided for in the package.


The four tasks covered in the Jupyter notebook are:  
1. Explain the overall purpose of the package.  
2. Explain the use of the “Simple random data” and “Permutations” functions.  
3. Explain the use and purpose of at least five “Distributions” functions.  
4. Explain the use of seeds in generating pseudorandom numbers.
